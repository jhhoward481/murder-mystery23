Description
- Ontario Lopez is the slightly older twin brother of [[25|Ottawa Lopez]] and a charismatic, fast-talking figure in the local social scene. Ontario always took on a protective role, making sure his sister and other friends were taken care of. Over the years, Ontario has made a name for himself as a smooth talker and a party enthusiast, often hosting extravagant gatherings in the neighborhood. Ontario is known for his charm, sense of humor, and the knack for persuading people to join in on his latest scheme. Ontario has a complicated history with the daughter of the formidable landlord, [[45|Gurn Blandsten]]. They were childhood friends, and their relationship was once very close. However, as they grew older, Gurn's business dealings and his daughter's increasing awareness of her family's reputation put a strain on their friendship. Their connection remains a guarded secret, and they maintain a complex relationship with each other, trying to reconcile their past with the expectations placed on them by their families.
- Ontario hopes to see Gurn's daughter at Atwater tonight, but figures she may be a no-show since her father will be there.
