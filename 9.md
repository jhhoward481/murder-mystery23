Description
- Dr. McTik-chk-tic-doc-clk is a extremely skilled surgeon, well respected in her field. Unfortunately, nobody knows that she secretly accidentally kills every single one of her patients and replaces them with clones that end up dying off after 10 years. She is a valuable military asset, having been active in the Ethioian military for much of her life. Through her research in experimental biomedical engineering and prosthetics, she met [[30|Nick Nack]], and is fascinated by his research. 
- An expert at the old handing-out-business-card move at parties, Dr. McTik-chk-tic-doc-clk is excited to meet some new potential clients at this very large and uneventful party.

Items:
#J
- you think perhaps this is a jug of clone blood (that's why it looks so weird). If it is, you desperately need it back

#F
- this looks strangely similar to some of the scalpels you've used in sketchy medial situations
#H
- you have so many awards, it's hard to keep track. maybe this is one of them?
