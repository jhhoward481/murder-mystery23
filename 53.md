Description
- Have you ever seen a Discord mod and been like, "Man I wish I had the time to be one of those!" Or have you ever seen the amount of likes someone's social post has raked in and thought to yourself, "If only I had the time and money and time to be as popular as THAT person!" If so, that sucks for you. Or at least that's what Walli Ali would think. A star on the internet ever since his miraculous delivery as an infant in the popular video "Baby Delivery Gone WRONG (Part 2. TWINS??)," Ali has never had to fight for fame. He simply posts videos of him and his two dogs talking about life, and people go crazy for it. Advertisers support his decadent lifestyle in a spacious Miami oceanfront property that he rebuilds everytime there's a hurricane (or even a warning of one) just so it can "stay fresh as the air he breathes."
- An inspiration to all, he hopes to make a cool video out of this evening at the luxurious Atwater Estate, known for its sleek modern design and architecture. Perhaps if the evening goes well, he might even adopt a new dog from popular animal shelter employee [[50|Bud]].
