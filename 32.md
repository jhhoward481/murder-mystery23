Description
- To people who know her, Yasmin Bleeth is a bit of a cheat. She'll do anything to make a quick buck, even if she has to cut off her own leg. Fortunately, ever since she befriended [[7|Methuselah Honeysuckle]], she hasn't had to do anything that desperate just yet. All she has to do is pretend to get injured in one of the accidents [[7|Methuselah]] seems to attract, and concerned bystanders donate money for her recovery. Unfortunately, Yasmin's slippery nature might be catching up with her. [[7|Methuselah]]'s quite reluctant to see her nowadays, and she suspects he might be catching on. Fortunately, Yasmin knows exactly where [[7|Methuselah]] is: the old Atwater Estate. Maybe she can sort things out.
