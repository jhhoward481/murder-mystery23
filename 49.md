Known by:

Description
- Superintendent of Davie County Public Schools by day, featherweight kickboxer by night, Rosie “Rosie the Riveter” Riveter is no dainty rose, and she’s not afraid to show some thorns. She has cut down many helicopter parents and overzealous teachers, with both solid administrative capabilities and a mean right hook if needed. She owes a bit of success to her lady-of-the-people and confidant [[42|Ingle Woods]], though the true depth of their relationship may cause some to doubt the legitimacy of Rosie’s “natural” athletic prowess.
- Rosie is always looking for new teachers, especially by preying on college students at the dumpy Atwater Estate.
