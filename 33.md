Description
- Hollabackatcha is a local soul-pop legend. His new spin on the traditional call-and-response song has blown up on TikTok and has led to youths everywhere yelling alternating words of songs at their phones in order to "shift it up" with their friends, as the kids say these days. Hollabackatcha promotes healthy living in his songs, and naturally is a strong supporter of gay chickens because he's never really liked how eggs taste. He's also a fan of the visual arts, with the works of [[35|Ernesto Agapito Garces con y a de Abelar]] being among his favorites. Just don't give him an egg, or you're an idoit and he'll yell back at you.
