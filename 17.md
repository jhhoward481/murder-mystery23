Description
- Irish daredevil Squirts MacIntosh is in quite the pickle. Inheriting his father's thrill-stunt-bike-show business, Squirts must make a living by one-upping local daredevils with increasingly dangerous stunts night after night. Squirts is terrified of danger, heights, speed, and fire, but he has to make a living somehow, and daredevilling is all he's ever known. He wears a motorbike helmet to hide his terrified face, and would do anything for a chance at another job. Perhaps [[25|Ottowa Lopez]], another figure used to living in someone's shadow, might have some advice at the thrill show at the Atwater Estate tonight.
