Name:
- François

Knows:
- [[12]]

Known by:
- 10
- 29

Description
- Well known thrill-hunter and conspiracy theorist, François is a lover of the mysterious. A fan of any kind of story (especially those written by [[12|D'Andre Pride]]) and other sources of a spiritual experience, François lives off of love of life. Like literally, he/she needs to be in the presence of others' spirits in order to survive. François collects crystals in order to have a balanced chi-fung-shway-thing, and would certainly be considered "spooky" and "out-there" by friends and enemies alike.
- Nobody knows quite what crosses the line with François, or how the dank souls of Atwater drew him/her to this party, but he/she does kinda bring a little life to the party, so nobody's complaining.

#C
- you may remember (parts of) a true out-of-body experience in Colorado, with this flag in particular.

#G
- you are an avid idol-worshipper because of the hibee-jibees you get from them; have you prayed to this one before?
#B
- two bananas? that can't be a good sign. Did your fortune-teller warn you about this?
