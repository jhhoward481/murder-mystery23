Description
- Burt “Oil Can” Guster, a rugged and somewhat mysterious mechanic, is no stranger to hard times and life's struggles. Known for his knack with engines and antique pencil sharpeners, he has moved from one job to another, always seeking a fresh start. While he vaguely recalls working with a nun during a brief stint at Saint Agnes Orphanage years ago, he can't quite place the details of their past interactions. Currently employed by landlord [[45|Gurn Blandsten]] at one of his auto repair shops, Burt's close association with [[45|Gurn Blandsten]] has raised eyebrows among the local community.
