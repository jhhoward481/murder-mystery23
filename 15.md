Description
- Slicks is probably the smartest criminal Los Angeles has never seen. He's allegedly killed dozens of people, but nobody's ever quite caught him in the act. He rolls up in a black matte ferari anywhere he goes, and never shows up late; you might even mistake him for a classy gentleman with his manners and nice suits. But at his core, he's a gangster. Folks say he got his money from selling tons and tons of used tires at affordable prices. But he's definitely a hardened, evil, criminal. He's a nice guy; his mama loves him. But if you look at him the wrong way, he *will* take note of it and you'll be dead by Christmas, kinda like a gift he's giving to himself.
- One thing's for sure about Slicks: He never gets his hands dirty. He just takes calls from his car all day. Recently, it's said he had a lovely phone call about cars with close friend [[20|U-Turn Singleton]], which has put him out of the killing mood a bit. Allegedly.
- He's in town for the famous weekly drag race down Method Road that wakes all of the college students up.
