Description
- Close rival to [[18|Bighead Burton]] on the race track, Billowy Bear jockeys in the top Russian Olympic Elite Horse Racing leagues. On the track, Bear is a lightweight jockey, but in upper Russian social circles, he's certainly a heavy-weight, always jockeying for prestige. His true skill is his ability to hold his breath underwater in 32Â° Russian lakes for minutes at a time. His nickname "Billowy" came from his unique ability to expand his lungs like a balloon underwater, keeping his organs warm, albeit resulting in a generally bloated figure. He's attracted the attention of North Asian monks, but in order to stay in touch with Russia's most wealthy, he perfoms his weekly spiritual yoga in secret. As everyone knows, Russian oligarchs do not respect limb-flexibility as much as the ability to freeze to death without dying. 
- Billowy is hoping to breathe in some new fungi in the catacombs beneath the Atwater Estate to enchance his time on the race track, in the lakes, and in the studio. He actually has no idea there is even a party going on here tonight
