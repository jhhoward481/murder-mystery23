Description
- Lemongrass is the closest you'll find to a real-life ghostbuster. She walks around everywhere with a vacuum and a tan leather jacket going on and on about midi-clorians. Watch your back while you're around her, because she seems to find a hard time telling between humans and "ghosts," and you might find your toes sucked up. Beacuse of how often ghosts are found near tornadoes, she knows [[7|Methuselah Honeysuckle]] pretty well. [[9|Dr. McTik-chk-tic-doc-clk]] is also a fellow ghost enthusiast, as many of her patients end up dying during surgery and she wants to make sure she keeps up that client-patient relationship.
