Description
- Mr./Mrs. Hugh Man is certainly NOT a large black and white cow, who has miraculously gained the ability to speak and walk in an extremely convincing manner. You’re silly for even thinking that. Hugh Man is also certainly NOT wearing a long, dark trenchcoat with a peculiar Uzi-shaped pocket by his/her hip. You should consider a visit to the eye doctor. And Hugh Man has absolutely NOT, in no way, shape, or form, been watching [[28|Eric Withakay]] and [[29|Lavender Gooms]] the whole night with a hint of malice behind his/her large, black eyes. Now you’re just making things up.
