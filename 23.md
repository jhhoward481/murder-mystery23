Description
- Retired professional MLB pithcer Hummingbird Saltalamacchia has enjoyed his first few months of not playing baseball. He's taken up interest in aquariums and marine life in general, finding a new hobby of spotting different fishes and getting into some of the most luxurious aquatic zoos across the US. He's met a bunch of interesting figures in all the cities he's visted, namely [[32|Yasmin Bleeth]], who seems to be a bit of a drifter, much like the lovable cuttlefish.
- He's been invited to the Atwater Annual Aquatic Benefit this evening to give a speech on some of his favorite fishes.
