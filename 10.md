Description
- Felicia is a professional gambler, and a good one at that. She needs no man. She only needs money, so she can keep on gambling. Most of her vacations come with paid-for hotel rooms, so as long as she can turn a profit at the tables, she can keep on living for free. Nobody knows quite how much money she makes, but it strikes everyone as odd that the house always seems to lose when Felicia Fancybottom is involved. 
- During some time out in Arizona, she met [[11|Fran√ßois]], and they've established something of a long-distance (questionably legal) report. And she seems to know [[9|Dr. McTik-chk-tic-doc-clk]] based on her social media page, though people can't figure out quite how such a respected doctor is affiliated with a rampant gambler. But hey, if she hasn't lost yet, maybe there's even more to her than what meets the eye already. 
- She is excited to play poker at the famous Atwater Kitchen Table; we'll be checking to see if she hides some cards up her sleeve.
