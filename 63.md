Description
- Chesterfield McMillan is a professional grandfather. Having married 8 times (to 7 different women), he's had a total of 18 children, all of whom have married and had kids of their own. Mysteriously (and might I add, tragically), each of his wives died shortly after her youngest child graduated kindergarten, leaving Chesterfield with tons of kids, and tons of experience. Nowadays, they've all grown up, and he's left as a constant favor-provider to his 18 kids and 103 grandchildren. Nobody knows what happened to all of his wives, but the ladies certainly don't mind because that means he's *available*.
- He's particularly had his eyes on [[50|Bud]] (It's a girls' name too!) because of how sweet she is (and he'd like to see if he can adopt some of her animals for his grandkids).
