Description
- Who doesn't love a good murder mystery? This is the question that got D'Andre Pride started on his first novel: *The Stink*. Since then, D'Andre has written over a dozen books that blend horror with mystery, the unknown with the known, intrigue with even more intrigue. He writes to inspire, to thrill, and to change the way you see the world. If you don't walk away from his book wanting to commit a crime, you probably read it wrong; and if he finds out you were nonplussed by his stories, well.... Let's just say he may find a new character for his next story in you.
- He's attending this party to do some people watching. One should always capture the chance for new free source material.
- He has his eye on [[13|Patricia Panic]], both because her name is cool, and because he thinks something may be worth writing about in her story.
