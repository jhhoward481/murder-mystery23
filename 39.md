Known by:

Description
- Suggs is a regular attender of the Dorothea Dix Mental Health Advisory and Correction Club at North Carmelina Skate University (he does think that's the real NCSU). He's not quite able to speak in full sentences all the time, but he's definitely a smart lad, capable of performing tasks as long as you give him a very specific set of instructions.
- He's a close friend to [[30|Nick Nack]] because they relate on a deep level to the robots they used to work on. Never leave them together for too long though, or you might have a slashing, bloodthirsty robot coming after you.
- He's been tricked to come to this party. He actually really hates people and wishes they were all robots.
