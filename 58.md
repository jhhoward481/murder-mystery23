Description
- A cyborg that runs a private military corporation. Has fought multiple giant metal monsters and won. Their best party trick is they can cut a watermelon into 128 evenly sliced pieces with their sword while reciting the entire Iliad. Unfortunately, due to their extremely poor sense of direction, they got lost and somehow ended up at the Halloween party while trying to get to Iceland.
