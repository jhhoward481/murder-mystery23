Known by:

Description
- Schoonie's backstory is as bad as it gets. His/her family is all in jail, serving mulitple life sentences, and he/she's been through rehab once or twice. Luckliy, the time on the streets has really led to a deep knowledge of these streets (literally, like the map/network of streets), and Schoonie has begun to develop an interest for city planning. Nick-named "U-Turn" for how he/she's turning his/her life around, Schoonie hopes to make it big if he/she can only get out of California
- Schoonie knows [[15|Slicks]] pretty well, since he's just down the road from San Fran; it'd be good to reconnect with him tonight.
