Description
- Young, aspiring, professional babysitter, Shmuel is a hit with all of the ladies specifically because of how good he is with kids. Middle child of 16 other siblings, Shmuel is no stranger to children, and actually has a harder time connecting with adults and folks his age who talk in complete sentences.
- Shmuel spends a lot of his time thinking about how he can keep his job as he grows older. With no plans to marry because he loves his many hobbies so much, he worries that as he gets older, his love for young children will be viewed as creepy instead of charming.
- Growing up with such a large family without much money, Shmuel and his siblings attracted the attention of L.A. crime boss [[15|Slicks]]. Variety Magazine called the story a "heartwarming charity thing," but Shmuel always found the whole thing peculiar and thought that Slicks was really just looking for a little bit of good press.
