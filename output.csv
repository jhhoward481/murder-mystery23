Description
"- You may have seen the name Withakay in the meats department of your local Aldi or Walgreens. Eric Withakay is the most successful cattle and goose rancher on this side of Lake Crabtree. He and his brother-in-law have worked closely together to develop a meat [[24|cattle]] farm that Gurn owns, and Eric operates, and it spreads for miles. In fact, Eric believes he owes his entire success to his brother-in-law and appreciates him greatly but has become increasingly aware that his brother-in-law has been growing tired of the smell of [[24|cattle]] on his land. Torn between appeasing his brother-in-law and securing the future of his livelihood, Eric hopes a nice party will help the tension between them (if he shows)."

"- Earnest Lambert Watkins owns the Atwater Estate. Somehow, through a series of unfortunate mishaps (some, or most of which may have had something to do with --REDACTED--), Earnest went from a random fourth-cousin-thrice-removed of Theo Atwater to the owner of the Atwater Estate after the deaths of Theo Atwater, his children, siblings, and distant relatives. Earnest’s quite pleased with his new arrangements, given the opulence of the Atwater Estate, but some say he’s still a bit suspicious about the quickness and convenience of his newfound wealth. Some even say he’s hired a half-decent private investigator named [[6|Greg]] to get to the bottom of the case. Whatever the case, Earnest Lambert Watkins is hosting his first festival as the owner of the Atwater Estate. He doesn’t want to mess anything up."

"- Ontario Lopez is the slightly older twin brother of [[25|Ottawa Lopez]] and a charismatic, fast-talking figure in the local social scene. Ontario always took on a protective role, making sure his sister and other friends were taken care of. Over the years, Ontario has made a name for himself as a smooth talker and a party enthusiast, often hosting extravagant gatherings in the neighborhood. Ontario is known for his charm, sense of humor, and the knack for persuading people to join in on his latest scheme. Ontario has a complicated history with the daughter of the formidable landlord, [[45|Gurn Blandsten]]. They were childhood friends, and their relationship was once very close. However, as they grew older, Gurn's business dealings and his daughter's increasing awareness of her family's reputation put a strain on their friendship. Their connection remains a guarded secret, and they maintain a complex relationship with each other, trying to reconcile their past with the expectations placed on them by their families."
"- Ontario hopes to see Gurn's daughter at Atwater tonight, but figures she may be a no-show since her father will be there."

He is bald, needs no helmet, and befuddles top scientists, who all insist the air resistance from his dome alone would slow down his steeds, or at least weigh them down enough to trip over their own legs. Bighead Burton pays no regard to his critics; he's his own biggest fan and doesn't care who knows it."

On the track, Bear is a lightweight jockey, but in upper Russian social circles, he's certainly a heavy-weight, always jockeying for prestige. His true skill is his ability to hold his breath underwater in 32° Russian lakes for minutes at a time. His nickname ""Billowy"" came from his unique ability to expand his lungs like a balloon underwater, keeping his organs warm, albeit resulting in a generally bloated figure. He's attracted the attention of North Asian monks, but in order to stay in touch with Russia's most wealthy, he perfoms his weekly spiritual yoga in secret. As everyone knows, Russian oligarchs do not respect limb-flexibility as much as the ability to freeze to death without dying."

"- Ovaltine Jenkins is the richest man in Eastern West Mississippi. Grizzled, old, with a head full of white hair, he can be a bit out of touch with these modern times, always going on and on about ""the way things used to be."" Any true southerner would know he got his start as a dairy farmer, but slowly worked his way through the ranks: farmer to milker, milker to taster, taster to chief frother, and from chief frother directly to the CEO of Milk Brothers Incorporated. Pioneering his new 100% chocolate-free chocolate is what made him his billions, and he still drinks it every day, hoping it can give him the youth he once had. If you comment on his age, or look at him without a jar of milk in your hand, he can probably pull some udders and have you killed before you can say ""Moo?"""

He rolls up in a black matte ferari anywhere he goes, and never shows up late; you might even mistake him for a classy gentleman with his manners and nice suits. But at his core, he's a gangster. Folks say he got his money from selling tons and tons of used tires at affordable prices. But he's definitely a hardened, evil, criminal. He's a nice guy; his mama loves him. But if you look at him the wrong way, he *will* take note of it and you'll be dead by Christmas, kinda like a gift he's giving to himself."

The most prevailing legend, however, is that Methuselah Honeysuckle just won’t die. He’s lived through many an accident and many a year, and he’s still dancing around like a madman afterwards. Of course, being the central fixture he is, Methuselah never turns down an opportunity to attend the Atwater Estate festival.
