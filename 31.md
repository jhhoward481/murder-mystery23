Description
- Mrs. Vocab is a highschool math teacher, so-so in her field, and a single mother of 3. She's constantly told by her students and colleagues that she should've "stuck with Language Arts" because of her "namesake" or whatever, but she is truly horrible at English and wonders why people can't look past her last name. Disheartened, she wonders if she'll ever be good at her job, or if maybe she could get married to someone with a less-embarassing last name so she doesn't have to carry so much shame around all the time. Perhaps [[48|Billowy Bear]] will marry her; he has a cool last name. And he's supposed to be at this Atwater gala tonight.
