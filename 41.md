Description
- You have never seen a face as beautiful as the face that is worn by supposed-human Immaculate Conception. Born at the young age of 19, Immaculate has always been a treat on the eyes to all ladies graced by his countenance. He doesn't have a job; people just give him money because of how much he lights up their worlds. He falls on the disinterested, callous side of the spectrum of people, and thinks that cows are far more interesting (and beautiful) creatures than any humans he's met. On a totally unrelated fact, he's close friends with [[24|Hugh Man]], local human unbovine in every way. The problem is, Immaculate Conception is on such a higher level than the rest of humanity, that he might accidentally kill you without even noticing that he's doing something bad.
