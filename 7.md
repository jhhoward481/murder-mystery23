Description
- Methuselah Honeysuckle
Methuselah Honeysuckle’s been a Raleigh fixture since time immemorial. Local legend says he was dancing during the ‘11 tornado and singing during the ‘88 tornado. There’s other legends too, some less believable than others (the most outlandish ones feature him being an old man when the Governor’s Mansion was built). The most prevailing legend, however, is that Methuselah Honeysuckle just won’t die. He’s lived through many an accident and many a year, and he’s still dancing around like a madman afterwards.
Of course, being the central fixture he is, Methuselah never turns down an opportunity to attend the Atwater Estate festival. The hosts and guests always like a lively jig danced by Raleigh’s resident old man.
