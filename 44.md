Description
- Blue Ivy Carter loves couch surfing and eating other people's food. She never has to pay for rent or a meal, but her social capital is getting spent day by day. She calls herself a startup graphic designer, but deep down she knows that she just wants to go back to school and live in the 24-hour library and read books all day.
- At least that's what she tells other people. Blue Ivy is actually a secret agent working for the CIA, but she would never tell anyone that because she would compromsie her chances of gaining valuable intel from couch surfing all the time.
- She's acting like a bum at this college party, but she's really looking for clues for a classified case. She needs to investigate [[30|Nick Nack]], potential serial killer and self-proclaimed millionaire.
