Description
- A native of the western Montana backcountry, Kai Yotee communicates only in the native tongue of the Austrian Montanian immigrants: yodeling. With speech incomprehensible to the folks “around these parts,” Kai must frequent the only Walgreens staffed by other Austrian Montanians, an establishment run by West Coast drug-lord [[20|"U-Turn" Singleton]]. He/she has managed to find success away from back home in Montana as a Liberty Tax streetside sign flipper, using his/her impressive voice to attract attention, and as a scarecrow, using a terrifying voice to scare crows.
