Description
- Trapezius Milkington is an expert at acrobatic rock climbing. He shows up to the rock climbing gym every other day wearing a leotard and a fold-out set of uneven bars. All it takes is to set up the uneven bars right next to the rock wall, start swinging, do a couple turns, then let your momentum carry you up the wall with a blend of rolling and limb-thrashing. Trapezius has many injuries from this innovative climbing strategy, leading him to conisder alternative sports with considerably less contact. Perhaps horse racing?
- He's here tonight to try to connect with famous jockey [[18|Bighead Burton]].
