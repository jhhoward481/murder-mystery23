Description
- Pronounced clinically insane for thirty years, when Dorothea Dix Mental Health Facility closed in 2010 Mr. William Ofrights was, to the shock of all his family, discharged and sent home. Within the year, his family had all died (by all accounts of natural causes), and Bill sold their house and disappeared. He has a perfectly unremarkable face, and his only distinguishing characteristic is a drag of his left foot from an accident sustained in the final year of his time at Dix.
- No one knows how his sudden reversal of fortunes came about, but some people suspect that a bribe from grease monkey [[3|Burt "Oil Can" Guster]], who fought with Bill in "the war", might have had something to do with it. He also is very interested in the history of lunatics living in The Illustrious Atwater Estate and its owner: [[5|Earnest Lambert Watkins]].
