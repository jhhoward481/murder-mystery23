Description
- You may have seen the name Withakay in the meats department of your local Aldi or Walgreens. Eric Withakay is the most successful cattle and goose rancher on this side of Lake Crabtree. He and his brother-in-law have worked closely together to develop a meat [[24|cattle]] farm that Gurn owns, and Eric operates, and it spreads for miles. In fact, Eric believes he owes his entire success to his brother-in-law and appreciates him greatly but has become increasingly aware that his brother-in-law has been growing tired of the smell of [[24|cattle]] on his land. Torn between appeasing his brother-in-law and securing the future of his livelihood, Eric hopes a nice party will help the tension between them (if he shows).
