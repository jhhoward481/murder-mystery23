Description
- Evelyn "Eve" Blandsten is the daughter of [[1|Chocolate Columbo]], the formidable culinary mogul. She is an intelligent and strong-willed young woman in her early 20s. Despite being born into privilege, Eve is not entirely comfortable with her father's pompous business dealings and wants to distance herself from his shadow. She has been secretly dating [[15|Slicks]], the hardcore criminal from LA. They met at one of Columbo's fancy business trips to the poor city of Los Angeles, where she occasionally can break free from the expected roles placed on her by her family. Eve and Slicks' relationship is a closely guarded secret, as Columbo would strongly disapprove of his daughter dating anyone from LA in general, much less a guy that drives cool black cars.

Items:
#B
- your father never lets you leave the house without two bananas as a snack; annoyingly, these might be the two you were trying to ditch this evening
  
#O
- you have a Forest green Owala just like this. But you don't know what these wrist bands would be from, so you're unsure if it's yours
#I
- you may remember your dad buying you one of these before, they all look so fancy and shiny that it's hard to tell a difference
