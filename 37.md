Description
- After a life of calamity and excitement as a one-handled juggler at the local Reinhardt Circus and Faire, Nelson Grace has been eager to find a life of leisure away from the spotlight. He hasn’t known any other life than one of performance, grandeur, swindling, and showmanship. Finally hoping to settle down in a quiet community, Nelson seems to be so close to escaping his exciting but questionable past. The only thing that may upend his future peace is a secret that he’s only disclosed to [[47|Boston Rob]]... the secret to his wild juggling ability: that he actually has TWO hands.
- He's interested in testing out the social scene amongst non-circus peoples at the party tonight. Conversation can be a bit intimidating, but it's certainly less intimidating than taming an elephant.
