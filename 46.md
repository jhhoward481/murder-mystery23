Description
- The one thing everyone knows about Darryl is that he cameod in High School Musical 2, as he never lets anyone forget it. He remains likeable enough in spite of that fact, in part because his propensity to buy drinks for everyone listening to him. How he comes by enough money to do this is unknown, but as long as he's paying, nobody's asking questions. Those few people who know that he's a custodian at the local middle school wonder how he can pay for it all.
- Darryl is only at this party by accident. His good friend, [[32|Yasmin Bleeth]], was stood up by her date, and she asked Darryl to go along last minute as a friend. Darryl, never overlooking the chance to tell more people about his one claim to fame, accepted.
