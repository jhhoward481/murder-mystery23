Description:
- World renown horse jockey Bighead Burton is a worldwide phenomenon. Having participated in derbies (pronounced "darbees") around the globe, he's gained cult-hero status, namely for being the only serious competitor with a head a foot and a half in diameter. He is bald, needs no helmet, and befuddles top scientists, who all insist the air resistance from his dome alone would slow down his steeds, or at least weigh them down enough to trip over their own legs. Bighead Burton pays no regard to his critics; he's his own biggest fan and doesn't care who knows it.
- During his time at the many horse races, he's fallen into the gambling ring of upper elite British nobility. He knows [[34|Ovaltine Jenkins]] will always bet on his horses, and owes him his notoriety and fame.
- After a particularly successful race, he's been invited to a luxurious ball at the Atwater Estate. He knows he will be a huge hit, so he eagerly anticipates attending.
