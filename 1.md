Description
- Chocolate Columbo is a dietary enthusiast, proud of his motherland, Switzerland. His joy in life is to experiment with different kinds of "meal-concepts," then pitch them to top chefs and chemists around the globe with the hopes that someday, a product of his own design might be sold in stores. This has, in fact, happened with 48 of his products already, but his delerious delicious delicacies demand dominance on domestic and delightfully foreign drugstore shelves. Because of health concerns, critics call Columbo a complete cancer to society, but he insists that all he wants to do is to spread the love of taste to the multitudes.
- Columbo is fully aware that [[34|Ovaltine Jenkins]] stole one of his formulas, but he doesn't mind; he lives to invent, not to profit. The one thing that would upset Columbo would be someone restricting his ability to create new flavors. Over that matter, he would kill you before you could half-turn a sifter crank.
- He is looking forward to the tastes of Raleigh, North Carolina, as he plans to make the pilgrimage to the famous "Food Lion" on his way to the yearly Atwater Estate FEASTival.
