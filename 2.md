Description
- Sister Hallie Looya is a devout and enigmatic nun who runs the Saint Agnes Orphanage, known for her unwavering dedication to the children currently or previously under her care. With a reputation for immense kindness, Hallie conceals a hidden grudge against [[3|Burt “Oil Can” Guster]], a former colleague at the orphanage who was fired under mysterious circumstances. Beneath her serene facade, she harbors secrets that hint at a complex and troubled past, making her a compelling storyteller, a skill she often uses to put the children to sleep. Sister Hallie is known for her piercing blue eyes and a soft-spoken demeanor, but her icy reserve hints at depths of emotion only God knows the true extent of.
- She's also familiar with [[1|Chocolate Columbo]], huge benefactor of the church and favorite of the hungry little rascals at the orphanage for his fun meal concepts.
