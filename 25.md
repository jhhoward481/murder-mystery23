Description
- Ottawa Lopez, twin sister to [[38|Ontario Lopez]] and lover of a good party, has lived her entire life under the shadow of her slightly older brother. Growing up orphans at Saint Agnes Orphanage, Ottawa can’t remember a single day without having to rely on or be supported by her brother. Lately, it seems [[38|Ontario Lopez]] is beginning to take advantage of the reliance she has on him, and she’s growing sick of it. Maybe tonight’s party will be her opportunity to finally be her true self.
