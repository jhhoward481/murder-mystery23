Description
- Earnest Lambert Watkins owns the Atwater Estate. Somehow, through a series of unfortunate mishaps (some, or most of which may have had something to do with Methuselah Honeysuckle), Earnest went from a random fourth-cousin-thrice-removed of Theo Atwater to the owner of the Atwater Estate after the deaths of Theo Atwater, his children, siblings, and distant relatives. Earnest’s quite pleased with his new arrangements, given the opulence of the Atwater Estate, but some say he’s still a bit suspicious about the quickness and convenience of his newfound wealth. Some even say he’s hired a half-decent private investigator named [[6|Greg]] to get to the bottom of the case. Whatever the case, Earnest Lambert Watkins is hosting his first festival as the owner of the Atwater Estate. He doesn’t want to mess anything up.
