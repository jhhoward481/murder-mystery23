Name:
- Greg

Knows:
- [[7]]

Known by:
- 5

Description
- No one knows where this mysterious man came from, so well-dressed and organized. No one knows why he seems to have a burning hatred for [[7|Methuselah Honeysuckle]]. No one knows why he keeps showing up at all the accidents Methuselah Honeysuckle seems to attract and inexplicably survive. All they know is one word, rasped out whenever he is asked for his name: GREG.
Greg has tracked Methuselah Honeysuckle for many a year now. The old man always seems to like the Atwater Estate festivals. Maybe this year, Greg can put the old man to rest, and finally get paid.
