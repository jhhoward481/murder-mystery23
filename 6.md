Description
- No one knows where this mysterious man came from, so well-dressed and organized. No one knows why he seems to have a burning hatred for [[7|Methuselah Honeysuckle]]. No one knows why he keeps showing up at all the accidents [[7|Methuselah Honeysuckle]] seems to attract and inexplicably survive. All they know is one word, rasped out whenever he is asked for his name: GREG.
Greg has tracked [[7|Methuselah Honeysuckle]] for many a year now. The old man always seems to like the Atwater Estate festivals. Maybe this year, Greg can put the old man to rest, and finally get paid.
