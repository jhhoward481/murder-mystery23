Description
- Galileo Humpkins is one of the nicest bounty hunters you will ever meet. He finds wanted criminals by floating between popular bars, over-sharing about his ex-wives, and occasionally chasing leads that come as a result. He always makes sure he shares a drink first with any criminals he brings in, just so they know that there's no hurt feelings or anything. 
- His biggest regret is that he never was able to build a deep relationship with [[21|Scrooge Jones]], a grumpy old Twitch Streamer arrested for extortion of his viewers in 2012. Humpkins was able to trace his IP and alert the authorities
  - Scrooge never forgave him
