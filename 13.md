Name:
- Patricia Panic

Knows:
- [[14]]

Known by:
- 12

Description
- Recent college grad that is very annoyed that all of her friends seem to be getting married. A member of a very large sorrority, she seems to attend a wedding every month, but every so often, a wedding ring will go mysteriously missing. As a totally unrelated fact, Patricia collects wedding bands because she wants to make sure she knows what she wants when she finally finds "the one"
- Really has her eyes on [[14]], hoping that this college party will bring out some of the nostalgia for the best-days-of-their-lives and that she can walk away from the event with a ring on her finger. As of now, [[14]] does not know she even exists, but such pleasantries don't bother Patricia in the slightest
