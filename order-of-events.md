## Setup
- print
  - 64 cards to hand out
    - print duplicates of all of them
  - 64 names to put on the board
  - evidence tags?
  - A-O 4x
- set up board with all names correctly on it 
  - names
    - on board
    - text side facing inward
    - card contains only name
  - attatched with pushpins
  - red yarn connecting all nodes
    - every intersection is where a names gets put
  - decorate it
    - write CONSPIRACY inside the circle
  - while names are being handed out, make some effort to hide it
- evidence
  - in box
  - each piece has a label
  - have 3 tags to put on the board for each piece of evidence, labelled A-O
  - have a list on a clipboard of the evidence listed alphabetically, prominently displaying the important letter
- give David murder weapon so he can be found dead with it
- see if I can get a pipe to smoke or something to make me look like a detective/PI
- 16 cups of who to vote as murderer
  - and 64 slips of paper for everyone to get a vote

## Arrival
- nametags
  - actual costume on top, character name underneath
- hand out cards
  - first few people
    - at this point, board should be fully set up
      - as people arrive, I should be removing names from the board (which should be somewhat hidden from view)
    - have a mix of cycle names and some of their children available. If not enough show up, can always switch out later
      - let each person pick 1 from like 2 or 3 options (gender options)
    - replenish cycle people until there's no more
  - after cycle members are handed out
    - only distribute children, give people 2 or 3 options of who they'd like to be
  - tell everyone to hold onto their character
- maybe wait 45 minutes or so to start

## Start
- gather everyone together
- David:
  - Introduce himself as billionaire that called together this party
    - speech about something
    - lights flash
      - he's dead! oh no
        - (Jack can assist with this as much as he needs to)
- Jack (Howard):
  - Things to make clear:
    - I was hired by David to investigate a plot on his life, and discovered there was a conspiracy. Unfortunately I couldn't save him in time because I could not pinpoint who was in this conspiracy. (flavor)
    - Everyone here has a card about information they need to share with others in order to figure out who killed David
    - If we can narrow it down to a circle of people connected to each other in some way (indicate somehow to the board), then this is the conspiracy that I was searching for. From there, we can figure out who the sole murderer was. 
      - "connected to" can be one way or two way relationships
    - If you have to leave, please come give me your card
    - Any one of you could be the murderer, but you're all far to clever to give that up yet
    - they have to affix the names in the correct pattern on the board; I will be checking to see if they have it correct
    - more of solving a puzzle than looking for evidence
  - cut them loose
    - flavor: whoever solves the murder gets a portion of David's billions

## Conspiracy Hunting
- board should be accessible to all
- David and I should be available for any questions
  - also should catch any new arrivals up to speed if they want to join
- hand out any replacement cards (see Setup) and hints (see Contingencies) as needed

## Evidence Start
- board should correctly match the solution, both cycle and non-cycle members
- gather everyone together
- make very clear to everyone:
  - the 16 cycle members are the suspects. One of them is the murderer
  - I as the detective have accumulated evidence, and I know that each piece of evidence corresponds to 1 suspect.
  - The problem is, I don't know which evidence goes with which person
    - and each suspect will only be able to remember 3 items that they think might be theirs.
  - It's up to everyone else (non-suspects) to figure out what evidence goes with each person
  - BUT THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION
    - the MURDERER knows they are the murderer, so they have to make up a story about which 3 items they're claiming are theirs, and you all have to be able to catch them in their lie. Their evidence is the knife
  - In just a moment, I will tell each suspect which 3 items might be theirs
  - then, they must REMEMBER that information as they defend themselves to the jury (everyone else)
    - once everyone has heard about their items, 
    - then everyone will deliberate and try to figure out what evidence goes with each suspect
  - then, everyone gets to vote on who they think is the murderer
  - Summary (put this in a visible place)
    - 1. Memories: 
      - 16 suspects are told the 3 items that might be theirs
    - 2. Deliberating/Remembering:
      - Suspects must remember their items (and the reasons for why they might be theirs) as they discuss with others and try to figure out what item goes with which person
      - Murderer has to lie to blend in
    - 3. Assigning Items:
      - Conclude which items likely go with each suspect, or get close enough. Should be close to determining murderer by process of elimination. 
    - 4. 
      - Time is up! Everyone places a vote on who they think is the murderer
  - Remember (put this in a visible place)
    - evidence relates to the backstory of each character
- give suspects a chance to look over all the evidence

### 1. Informing the Suspects
- bring each suspect aside to a private area
- remember to switch up the order of what's on the sheet
- normal suspect
  - purpose: "You forget which of these is yours, but you know it's one of these three"
  - tell them their 3 potential items, each with a reason.
  - speak clearly, but no repeating, and no writing down
  - release them, but tell them they can't talk with anyone about what they learned until everyone's back
- murderer
  - purpose: "Blend in, or you get found out"
  - inform them that they were the murderer and for what reason
  - tell murderer that each item can have at most 4 people that go with it, so be careful there
  - ask if they have any questions
- once everyone has had the meeting, let discussion commence

### 2. Deliberating
- once everyone has had the meeting, let discussion commence
  - now they can write stuff down
- be available to answer questions or give hints as needed
- make sure Summary and Remember sections from above are visible in some way

### 3. Assigning Items
- let them know that time is running out whenever I feel like it. Time to vote soon, so finish up!

### 4. Vote
- let everyone cast a vote, including suspect, non-participants, and the murderer

## Reckoning
- tally how many votes were cast for each suspect, increasing order
- reveal the murderer
- if not many voted for the murderer, then give away some of the evidence to the few who did get it right (don't announce any potential prizes beforehand)
- if a lot of people voted for the murderer, see if they want to vote on an MVP to win the lamp or not... idk
- thank everyone for playing





## Contingencies
- if the murderer leaves early
  - ask someone else in the party to give up their role for this one because it's one of the important ones
- if a cycle member leaves early
  - pre-evidence-drop
    - ask someone else
    - or just give them the card and make them figure out where the name goes on the board
  - post-evidence-drop
    - reveal what items were theirs (putting pins up on the board), and the reasons for why those were their items. let them figure out the rest
- if a child leaves early
  - put their name back in and hope someone else takes it (or just hand it out to the next person that arrives)
  - or just give their card to everyone else and let them figure out where they go in the graph
- if people can't figure out the circle after 45-ish minutes
  - give them 5 more minutes, saying that the circle is the most important part
    - still can't
      - reveal it (flavor it as detective breaking through in the case)
- if people can't agree on the evidence in 30-ish minutes
  - start dropping hints of what items go where (max 10)
  - force the vote if still very stuck
- if they find a map that works for the evidence that somehow isn't the right one
  - say that that was an error in the math, but a verified dead-end

Flavor
- the evidence thing is meant to simulate you these being things you've seen before, and are tied to your story, but your memory isn't good enough to remember everything you've ever seen
