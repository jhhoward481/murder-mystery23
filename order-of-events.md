## Setup
- print
  - 64 cards to hand out
    - print duplicates of all of them
  - 64 names to put on the board
  - evidence tags?
  - A-O 3x
- set up board with all names correctly on it 
  - names
    - on board
    - text side facing inward
    - card contains only name
  - attatched with pushpins
  - red yarn connecting all nodes
    - every intersection is where a names gets put
  - decorate it
    - write CONSPIRACY inside the circle
  - while names are being handed out, make some effort to hide it
- evidence
  - in box
  - each piece has a label
  - have 3 tags to put on the board for each piece of evidence, labelled A-O
  - have a list on a clipboard of the evidence listed alphabetically, prominently displaying the important letter
- give David murder weapon so he can be found dead with it

## Arrival
- nametags
  - actual costume on top, character name underneath
- hand out cards
  - first few people
    - at this point, board should be fully set up
      - as people arrive, I should be removing names from the board (which should be somewhat hidden from view)
    - have a mix of cycle names and some of their children available. If not enough show up, can always switch out later
      - let each person pick 1 from like 2 or 3 options (gender options)
    - replenish cycle people until there's no more
  - after cycle members are handed out
    - only distribute children, give people 2 or 3 options of who they'd like to be
  - tell everyone to hold onto their character
- maybe wait 45 minutes or so to start

## Start
- David:
  - Introduce himself as billionaire that called together this party
    - speech about something
    - lights flash
      - he's dead! oh no
        - (Jack can assist with this as much as he needs to)
- Jack:
  - Things to make clear:
    - I was hired by David to investigate a plot on his life, and discovered there was a conspiracy. Unfortunately I couldn't save him in time because I could not pinpoint who was in this conspiracy. (flavor)
    - Everyone here has a card about information they need to share with others in order to figure out who killed David
    - If we can narrow it down to a circle of people connected to each other in some way (indicate somehow to the board)






## Contingencies
- if the murderer leaves early
  - ask someone else in the party to give up their role for this one because it's one of the important ones
- if a cycle member leaves early
  - pre-evidence-drop
    - ask someone else
    - or just give them the card and make them figure out where the name goes on the board
  - post-evidence-drop
    - reveal what items were theirs (putting pins up on the board), and the reasons for why those were their items. let them figure out the rest
- if a child leaves early
  - put their name back in and hope someone else takes it (or just hand it out to the next person that arrives)
  - or just give their card to everyone else and let them figure out where they go in the graph
- if people can't figure out the circle after 45-ish minutes
  - give them 5 more minutes, saying that the circle is the most important part
    - still can't
      - reveal it (flavor it as detective breaking through in the case)
- if people can't agree on the evidence in 30-ish minutes
  - start dropping hints of what items go where (max 10)
  - force the vote if still very stuck


items
- "You forget which of these is yours, but you know it's one of these three"
