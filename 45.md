Description
- Gurn Blandsten is a formidable figure in the community, wearing multiple hats as a ruthless landlord, shopkeeper, and shrewd real estate mogul. His reputation for being unforgiving towards shoplifters and associates precedes him, and he has relentlessly been amassing evidence to build a strong case against the notorious [[38|Ontario Lopez]], intending to deliver a decisive blow to his/her illicit activities. Gurn's imposing presence, complete with a perpetually furrowed brow and a penchant for donning well-tailored suits, makes him a character of both respect and fear.
