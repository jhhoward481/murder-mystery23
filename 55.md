Description
- Comic book legend, Magic Head is known as one of the highest paid and most iconic authors of the neo-modern comic book era. Always writing characters with telepathic powers or huge brains, Head's closest supporters have begun to suspect that he/she even has superpowers him/herself that would be classified technically as paranormal-super-extranatural-big-brain-ness. Does Magic really have the power to control and read the minds of all those who read his/her comics? Or is this another case of a really good author attracting a ton of crazy bloodthirsty fans? The comic book convention at the Atwater Estate this evening should decide, once and for all.
- Knows [[53|Walli Ali]], a popular fan on Magic Head's media site: toobigbraintothink.com
- Knows [[12|D'Andre Pride]] for his work in horror literature. Head admires his work greatly and is thrilled he will be making an appearance this evening.
