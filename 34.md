Description
- Ovaltine Jenkins is the riches man in Eastern West Mississippi. Grizzled, old, with a head full of white hair, he can be a bit out of touch with these modern times, always going on and on about "the way things used to be." Any true southerner would know he got his start as a dairy farmer, but slowly worked his way through the ranks: farmer to milker, milker to taster, taster to chief frother, and from chief frother directly to the CEO of Milk Brothers Incorporated. Pioneering his new 100% chocolate-free chocolate is what made him his billions, and he still drinks it every day, hoping it can give him the youth he once had. If you comment on his age, or look at him without a jar of milk in your hand, he can probably pull some udders and have you killed before you can say "Moo?"
- Unbeknownst to many, he actually stole the formula for his chocolate-free chocolate from the Swiss mad scientist [[1|Chocolate Columbo]]. Jenkins will stop at nothing to keep this sectret safe.
- This gala thrown at the Atwater Estate seems like a prime time for the Jenkins to keep tabs on Columbo; he will have his eyes peeled for every moment of the night.
