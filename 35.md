Description
- One of Spain's finest abstract artist, Ernesto is into the now. He's only into trends before they're popular. Paint? Antiquated. Colored Pencils? They had those in the stone age. Painting with egg-whites? Old news! Ernesto Agapito Garces con y a de Abelar only sketches with digital retroframe pixel-bursts; he only paints with 4D-printed pieces of the sky. He has a deep appreciation for the hands-off method of graphic design employed by [[44|Blue Ivy Carter]], and hopes to spice up the walls of Atwater this evening with some new colors he invented. Just don't bring up any of the "traditional" colors to him, or his face might get as red as marmasuckle.
