Feedback
- Make sure connections are all both ways because it's confusing if the only person you know isn't there
  - response:
    - Supposed to be kind-of hard to figure out everyone, but maybe this would work. This would make it possible for everyone to have at least 2 names on their sheet
    - probably would be easier to just make all connections both ways
- Didn't know the second phase was supposed to be social deception; would have interrogated/tried to read people more
  - clarify that mroe, I guess?
