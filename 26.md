Knows:

Description
- Dequan is a medical test subject, used by some of the leading medical companies to test new vaccines. He's compensated generaously for all his work, and lives quite comfortably, aside from the few experiments that have gone wrong. He received his nickname-sake after a particularly rusty vaccine reintroduced smallpox to a local sea-lion population. Fortunately, Dequan was not held responsible for the damages because of some paper he signed.
- He has a soft demeanor, but always looks like he's holding back a cough. Drinking alcohol gets him into medical trouble, as he learned one time wine tasting with [[40|Supersmeller Bigshnoz]], so he religiously steers clear from the juice. But other than that, he's very laid back. Just don't shake his hand.
