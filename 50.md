Description
- "Yes, Bud CAN be a girls' name!" is what Bud has been saying all her life. Named after the budding rose her father handed her mother on their very first dance, Bud grew up in the sweetest of homes. She decided her lifelong calling was to work with animals at an animal shelter, and never looked back. Every day, she gets to see a puppy (or sometimes a cat I guess) get adopted into its new forever home. The joy, the smiles, the tears... precious. Her parents are "so proud of all she's become," and really, isn't she finding more joy than any of we are chasing our degrees?
- She's always looking for more people in need of a pet so she'll be at the college party tonight at Atwater. Maybe she can get a chance to find her "forever home" as well if she happens to see dreamy [[63|Chesterfield McMillan]]. Oh that would really would be lovely.
- Oh, side note: she will kill anyone who's ever hurt an animal.
